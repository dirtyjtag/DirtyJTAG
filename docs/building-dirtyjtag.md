# Building DirtyJTAG

## Manual build

In order to compile DirtyJTAG, you will need the following software:

 * git
 * ARM toolchain (I'm using Fedora's `arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs`/`arm-none-eabi-newline` packages)
 * make

Clone this repository :

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jeanthom/dirtyjtag
cd dirtyjtag
```

Then you can build all the firmware versions :

```
make
```

Once the build is completed, your freshly compiled firmware will be available in `src/` as a binary file.

If you only want to build a specific configuration of DirtyJTAG, directly call the right Makefile with the correct parameters for the platform and the bootloader type. Before that, make sure you have a build of unicore-mx.

```
make -C unicore-mx all
make -f Makefile.stm32f1 PLATFORM=bluepill LOADER=noloader
```

`PLATFORM` could be any of the following:

 * `bluepill`
 * `stlinkv2`
 * `stlinkv2white`
 * `baite`
 * `olimexstm32h103`

`LOADER` could be any of the following:

 * `noloader`: No bootloader
 * `loader2k`: Bootloader is occupying 0x0-0x2000, DirtyJTAG starts at 0x2000 offset
 * `loader4k`: Bootloader is occupying 0x0-0x4000, DirtyJTAG starts at 0x4000 offset

You should use the `noloader` variant if your microcontroller hasn't been programmed with a bootloader. If you are using a bootloader (eg. [dapboot](https://github.com/devanlai/dapboot)), you may use the `loader2k` or `loader4k` options depending on the base address that will be executed by the bootloader (`loader2k` => 0x08002000, `loader4k` => 0x08004000).

## Docker build

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or podman) installed on your computer, you can also choose to build inside a container:

```
docker build https://github.com/jeanthom/DirtyJTAG.git --output type=tar,dest=dirtyjtag.tar
```

At the end of the build process, you'll find a `dirtyjtag.tar` archive containing all the build artifacts.

## Docker multistage build

The Dockerfile has been updated to use a multistage build process that includes only the necessary binaries and flashing tools. This ensures that the final image is as small as possible.

To build the Docker image using the multistage build process, run the following command:

```
docker build -t dirtyjtag:latest .
```

This will create a Docker image named `dirtyjtag:latest` that contains only the binaries and flashing tools.

Note: The final stage of the Docker multistage build includes only the binaries and flashing tools.
