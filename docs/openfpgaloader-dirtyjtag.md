# Using DirtyJTAG with openFPGAloader

<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader">Project page</a></p>

openFPGAloader is a JTAG tool dedicated to FPGA flashing. It is compatible with numerous FPGA families.

openFPGAloader supports the DirtyJTAG probe since [v0.1](https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader/releases/tag/v0.1). Instructions for manually building openFPGAloader are available in the project repository.
